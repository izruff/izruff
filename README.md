I'm Rafael, a first-year Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore!

I like math, I like code, I like chocolate.

## ðŸŒ± Projects

### _Reviu_ web forum

A modern web forum, originally made for the [CVWO Winter Assignment](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vwo/). Uses Typescript, React, Golang, PostgreSQL, and other stuff. It's still in progress, and far from done!

## ðŸŒ  Contributions

### Recent open source contributions

(This part is work-in-progress!)

### Continued development of [Source Academy](https://github.com/source-academy)

Working on new features for [Source Academy](https://github.com/source-academy) (SA), the platform we use for teaching [CS1101S](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS1101S/programming-methodology) to students at NUS.

I and my partner are currently working on improving _Sessions_. It is a medium for collaborative editing in the SA Playground, powered by [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb). You can find our PRs [here](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asource-academy+author%3Aizruff&type=pullrequests).
